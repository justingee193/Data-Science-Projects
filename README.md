* ## Machine Learning
	* [Graduate Admissions](https://github.com/justingee193/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/graduate-admissions.ipynb): Created an optimized model to predict an individual's chance of acceptance to graduate school. Identified the strongest components to a graduate admissions application utilizing machine learning.
	* [Customer Purchasing Behavior](https://github.com/justingee193/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/customer-lifetime-value.ipynb): Testing various Hierarchical Bayesian models that accurately predicts future customer purchasing behavior and lifetime value, to identify returning customers for a fictional e-commerce store. 
* ## Data Analysis & Visualization
	* Python
		* [Student Performance Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/justingee193/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/student-performance.ipynb): Exploratory analysis of student information, focusing on student grades, social and school related activities using Seaborn visualizations.

* ## Additional Projects
	* Python
		* [Heart Disease](https://github.com/justingee193/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/heart-disease.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an individual has or does not have heart disease.
		* [Income Brackets](https://github.com/justingee193/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/income-bracket.ipynb): Using K-Nearest Neighbors to predict whether an individual earns less than 50K or more than 50K.
	* R
		* [Car Prices](https://rpubs.com/justingee193/rprof_lm): Using Linear Regression to predict the price of a car give its features.
